# GSM Gadgetry
The GSM Gadgetry project aims to demonstrate simple integration with the SIM900 GSM/GPRS modem using the .NET Gadgeteer platform and the .NET Micro Framework.

The example program shows using Sim900Client to send a text message via SMS, which is based on SIM900 AT Command Manual v1.03. At the time, the program was run on a FEZ Panda II.

Only a handful of commands are actually available in this initial commit. Although, you may also expect to find some attempt at using GPRS commands for TCP/IP data, which would naturally be the next step to hopefully make this project a little more exciting...
